<p>Activating Apartment Building Buzzer Door Open Button Remotely Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange Inspect it for any wear and tear. Step 1 - Assess the Buzzer. Use the voltage meter to test the voltage of your intercom system because this could be a potential reason it isnt working. But what to do when your apartment buzzer stops working. If its just your flat that cant let somebody in then its most likely a problem with the button on your handset or the handset as a whole. If others are also having the problem then it could be one of these issues.</p>
