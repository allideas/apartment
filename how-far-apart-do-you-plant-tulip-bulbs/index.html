<p>Growing Care Wooden Shoe Tulip Farm Plants Bulb Flowers Planting Bulbs There is a mnemonic bridge to remember how deep and how far apart your flower bulbs plant. So for example if your bulb is 2 inches tall youd plant it 6 inches deep. The proper planting depth for spring-flowering bulbs is important for overall plant health as well as ensuring the bulbs will bloom. Set the bulb so the pointy end is facing up. Water well once and wait for spring. Plant your Tulips a little deeper because the soil will be cooler.</p>
