<p>Architecture Sketch Blog Deseopolis Neue Vahr Bremen Alvar Aalto Alvar Aalto Architecture Sketch Architecture Alvar Aalto buildingsArchitect Alvar Aalto. Alvar Aalto Apartments contains not only a pictorial record of Aaltos collective housing but also an extensive discussion of Aaltos ideals about dwelling. The Neue Vahr area of Bremen was one of the largest housing developments to be built at one time in Europe in the 1960s. The building consists of one-room and small two-room apartments. The Aalto office was one of fifty-three internationally renowned architecture offices from fourteen countries that were invited in 1955 to design a block of flats for the 1957 Interbau Exhibition. Seen from the west the building looks like an extended linear building but from the east it appears to be two solitary buildings l inked by a narrow central part the base of which a raised ground floor with column allows for a generous entrance with views of the surrounding greenery.</p>
