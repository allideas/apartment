The rich and warm sound of these acoustic guitars is very impressive. An acoustic is supposed to be loud its meant to fill a room without an amp. The top acoustic guitars that I would recommend include D-150 M-240E OM-150 F-1512E 12 String. Yes thats what I do keep volume very low below normal TV volume level even no distortion just clean soft playing a half hour here and there.
