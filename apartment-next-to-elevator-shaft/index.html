<p>Pin By Michelle Aldis On Dream Home House Elevation House Lift Elevator Design The air that escapes from open vents at the top of elevator shafts can be a major energy drain for your building because boilers are forced to run overtime to replace the warm air. They call it Twin. This apartment was on a major road and had constant droning of traffic minimun sized rooms and no dining area at all yet the only thing they complained about was the elevator noise and hearing. The engineers at ThyssenKrupp in Germany have developed a new way to have two elevator cabins within a single elevator shaft. Rather than taking the stairs he decided instead to use a key to unlock the elevator doors to have a look inside the shaft. 150-sq ft minimum with 8-foot minimum dimension 3 square feet per person for 25 of occupants and 30-inch by 48-inch wheelchair for each 50 occupants.</p>
